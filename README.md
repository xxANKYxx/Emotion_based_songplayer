# Emotion_based_songplayer

The interaction between human beings and computers will be more natural if computers are able to perceive and respond to human non-verbal communication such as emotions.
In recent years deep learning has progressed much in the field of image classification
1.In  this project i have created song player that captures emotion and plays song related to it
for eg==
 1. if detected happy ,it plays happy song.
 2.if detected frustated/anger ,it plays relaxing song
 3.and we can add more song for different emotions
